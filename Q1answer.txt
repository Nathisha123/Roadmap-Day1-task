Qn: Difference between http 1.1 and http2
http 1.1:-
=>It is the first usable version of http created in the year of 1997 by IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force).
=> It loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded it blocks all the resources behind it.
=>It compresses the data by   itself.
=>It works on the textual format for the http requests.
=>It is used when connecting to a server with http or https.
=>It used the concept of pipeling to send multiple requests over a single connection in sequence.

http 2:-
=>It was created in the year 2015 over SPDY protocol by IETF.
=>It uses a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no resources are blocked by any other resource.
=>It uses HPACk for data compression that eliminates the reduntant information in http header packets.
=>It works on binary protocol.
=>It is used when connecting to a server with https only.
=>It used the concept of Multiplexing which allows the browser to send multiple requests in parallel over a single connection
=>It has server push feature which proactively pushes cacheable content to the clients by anticipating future requests which the current request might depend.
