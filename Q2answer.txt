Qn: Object and its internal representation in Javascript.
Answer:
//An object can be called as a container for named values.
//Objects are inportant datatypes in Javascript but different than the primitive datatypes like numbers, string, boolean etc.
//Primitive datatypes can hold one value but objects can hold many vaues in the form of key:value pair.
//The key:value pair is called properties in object
//The keys can be variable or functions.
//Each member of an object is a key: value pair separatad by the commas and enclosed in curly braces{}.
//The actions performed on objects are called methods.
//Unassigned properties of an object are undefined and not null.
//Objects are commonly declared using the const datatype.
//The "this" keyword in javascript refers to an object. 

##An object can be initialised using object.create() format.
## Objects can also be defined in a single line format
           const.object_name ={key1:value1, key2:value2};
##  Objects can also be declared as
           const.object_name={
            key1:value1;
            key2:value2;
           }      
## To access object properties:
           objectname.propertyname;
           objectname["propertyname"];

## To access object methods:
           objectname.methodname();
